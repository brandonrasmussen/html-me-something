HTML Me Something, Part I: HTML

Your mission is to build a page that:

Tells a story. This can be personal or impersonal, funny, serious or neither. You can do whatever you like, but generally, 
it should be something in the range of 3-10 paragraphs or sections.

Does each of the following:

- Uses each of the following structural HTML5 tags: <p>, <header>, <footer>, <main>, <article>. If you need to brush up on what 
each of these tags is used for, or if any of them are new to you, check out the HTML tag reference at w3schools.

- Uses at least one <img> tag (and hopefully more). When placing images in your page, put them in a new subfolder called images 
within your html-me-something directory.

- Uses at least one HTML entity. Hint: putting a copyright notice in your footer will afford you the opportunity to use &copy;, 
but you should also try to get creative here.

- Is creative. Don't stop with these items or tags. Have some ideas for your page, and make it great. 

HTML Me Something, Part 2: CSS

Here are some specific requirements you should fulfill:

- Use margin and padding to space your elements in a visually pleasing way.
- Use at least one of each of the following types of selectors: element, class, id.
- Don't break these rules:
    ~ At all costs, avoid adding HTML elements in order to achieve a specific visual effect.
    ~ Use document-level and inline styles sparingly, and only when absolutely necessary.
    ~ As before, be creative! Make your page look great, and don't settle for checking off the items above.
